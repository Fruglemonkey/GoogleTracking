#Mass tracking in vehicular networks

In Vehicular Access Networks (VANET), privacy is a major concern. It is
important that entiries/attackers can't track a single person/vehicle over the
length of their journey.

However, with the advent of smart devices such as cellphones and GPS navigation
devices, with GPS and wifi capabilities, if a single device maker reaches market
a high level of market penetration then it is possible for that manufacturer to
use signals received from those devices to 'track' vehicles passively. This
project aims to simulate this scenario.

Requires pygraph and graphviz for handy visualisation. Runs in python 2.7
